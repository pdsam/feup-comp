/*  Test: direct access to various ways of getting an array
    This test is supposed to PASS!!

    During the test we try to access the three ways of getting an array:
by accessing a variable of type array, by accessing an array returned by
a method and by accessing a newly constructed array.
    Although this is support in j-- and is not really an extra, we wanted
to confirm that this worked and we did allow such cases that are also valid
in Java.
